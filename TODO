* Remove dom4j.jar (and that includes the license) and javax.jms.jar.
	Instead these should be downloaded during the build process from the
	Maven ibiblio repository for dom4j and geronimo-specs
* Automatic test suite based on NUnit (ships with mono)
* Java to CLR Callbacks / classes extending C# proxies
* Documentation
	- Caffeine.Jni ECMA API
* Generators
	- java.lang.Throwable should extend JThrowable
	- java.lang.String should extend JString
	- Elimintae new/override warning in JNIImpl classes (interfaces only)
	- CallXXX using JValue[] instead of "params object[]" boxing (performance)
	- Peer classes (Java wrappers)
	- Keywords "new" and "override" not covered completely when a class overwrites
	or implements a protected/package interface/class.
	- Static methods in derived classes that hide a static method in the parent
	class are not handled correctly. C# requires the keyword "new" for these.
	- Exceptions in signature

Strange BYTECODE in RT.JAR:

sun/security/krb5/internal/ccache/bo.class 
	[non-inner class marked as static]
