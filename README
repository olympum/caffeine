About JNI.NET
============

JNI.NET is a set of bindings for the .NET platform of the Java Native 
Interface (JNI). JNI.NET allows direct invocation of Java libraries from.NET. 
For convenience, JNI.NET provides a.NET shared assembly of the Java runtime.
JNI.NET is part of the free open source project Caffeine [1].

The foundation of JNI.NET are a set of.NET bindings for JNI using P/Invoke. 
The core of JNI.NET is a generator toolchain that generates C# proxy classes 
which replicate 1:1 their Java peers, and provides the necessary plumbing, 
via JNI, to call the Java VM.

JNI.NET is licensed under an MIT/X OSI certified license. You should have
received a LICENSE file in the same directory as this README file.
